## Stakeholders

Heather (Student):

- She doesn't visit food trucks often because there are small time gaps so she couldn’t wait.
- The line can be so long, and she would not be willing to wait.
- She pays by cards, but sometimes there’d be a surcharge if she doesn't have cash on hand.

Chase (Student):

- Food trucks change and relocate frequently on campus, but the same one consistently shows up. So he would like to see updates on a map.
- As someone who studies who study in Bobst, it's hard to predict if the food trucks outside are busy and it's too much work to get the food and wait.
- He said it would be great if there's an order in advance, and he see the menu prices

Fandianr (Purple food truck) that has been operating on campus for more than 15 years:

- They worry about in-person and mobile orders, as the workflow can get really chaotic
- With order pickup, by the time students arrive to pick it up, the food will have already gotten cold.
- Some items can be served right away, but others need to be fried on the spot
- Students like seeing that fried food is made fresh, and they wants everything to be served hot.

## Product Vision Statement

Violet Order is The fastest way for NYU students to discover food trucks, see real wait times, and order ahead, while giving vendors the tools to sell smarter.
